                <p>Jellyfish, also known as sea jellies or simply jellies, are the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous
                    members of the subphylum Medusozoa, which is a major part of the phylum Cnidaria. Jellyfish are
                    mainly free-swimming marine animals, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than
                    being motile. They are made of an umbrella-shaped main body made of mesoglea, known as the bell, and
                    a collection of trailing tentacles on the underside.</p>

                <p>Starfish or sea stars are a class of marine invertebrates generally shaped like a star polygon. (In
                    common usage, these names are also often applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as
                    brittle stars or basket stars.) Starfish are also known as asteroids because they form the taxonomic
                    class Asteroidea . About 1,900 species of starfish live on the seabed, and are found in all the
                    world's oceans, from warm, tropical zones to frigid, polar regions. They can occur from the
                    intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, at 6,000 m (20,000 ft) below the surfac</p>

                <p>A seahorse (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is any of 46 species of small marine bony fish in
                    the genus Hippocampus. The genus name comes from the Ancient Greek hippókampos , itself from híppos
                    meaning "horse" and kámpos meaning "sea monster" or "sea animal". Having a head and neck suggestive
                    of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile
                    tail.</p>
